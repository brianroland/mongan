# mongan

A series of problems from Mongan's book.

For example, the first problem in chapter 4 is solved with code in
  
  mongan/mongan_41/functions_and_classes_41

and the functions and classes that implement the solution are tested in
  
  mongan/mongan_41/tests_41/basic_tests/test_mongan_41.cpp

using the googletest unit testing framework.
